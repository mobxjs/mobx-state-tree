# mobx-reactive2015-demo

Demo of MobX (formerly called Mobservable) on [ReactiveConf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEwLwiizlk0)

Simple drag & drop editor that uses [mobx](https://github.com/mweststrate/mobx) and React.
The slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16hE-cxJ8C5XQVjql17krNAeYNF_9I3n3j13ho-KLWYU/edit#slide=id.p).

To interact with the application:

-   Click to select.
-   Boxes can be dragged around.
-   Use the input box to rename stuff.
-   CTRL + click to add new boxes. If there is an active selection an arrow will be added as well.
-   use the tiny buttons in the bottom left to generate a bunch of random boxes and arrows, and to travel forward and backward in time.

### Run the example

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:4000
```
